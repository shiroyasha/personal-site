While you are using a nice and confy rails environment, where everything you need is already loaded for you, you don't really worry about loading your code. But, the moment you want to write a pure ruby script or do something outside of the rails environment the problems with code loading get really obvious and frustrating. Writting anything more involved without some code loading strategies is a certain way to get lost in you project.
